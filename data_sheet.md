# Datasheet for London Bike Share Journey Analysis

## Motivation

The dataset was created by Transport for London (TfL) to provide a comprehensive view of bicycle journeys within the TfL Cycle Hire system, aiming to promote transparency and enable analysis of urban mobility patterns, station performance, and cycling preferences. The dataset was likely funded by TfL as part of their public data initiative.
 
## Composition

The dataset comprises 776,527 instances, each representing a single bike journey taken in August 2023.  For each journey, the dataset records the unique trip ID, the start and end date and time, the start and end station IDs and names, the unique bike ID, the bike model, and the total duration of the trip in both human-readable format and milliseconds.

The dataset appears to be complete, with no missing values in the core features used for analysis. It does not contain any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data. 

Features:
- Number: A unique identifier for each trip (Trip ID).
- Start Date: The date and time when the trip began.
- Start Station Number: The identifier for the starting station.
- Start Station: The name of the starting station.
- End Date: The date and time when the trip ended.
- End Station Number: The identifier for the ending station.
- End Station: The name of the ending station.
- Bike Number: A unique identifier for the bicycle used.
- Bike Model: The model of the bicycle used.
- Total Duration: The total time duration of the trip (in a human-readable format).
- Total Duration (ms): The total time duration of the trip in milliseconds.

## Collection process

TfL collected the data through the Cycle Hire system's automated tracking mechanisms. The dataset covers the entire month of August 2023 and represents the full population of bike journeys within the system during that period.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

It is unclear whether the raw data was saved in addition to the processed data. The data used in the analysis underwent several preprocessing steps, including date/time conversion, feature extraction (day of the week, hour, duration in minutes), addition of cyclical features (hour_sin, hour_cos), outlier handling (capping of duration_minutes), one-hot encoding of categorical variables (start station, end station, day of the week), and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
 
## Uses

The primary uses of this dataset are demand prediction (to optimise bike allocation) and maintenance prediction (based on usage patterns). However, it can also be used for various other tasks, such as analysing the impact of weather or events on bike usage, evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or promotions, optimising bike paths and station locations, and studying transportation patterns within the city.

The aggregated and anonymised nature of the dataset mitigates most ethical concerns. However, future users should be aware of potential biases if certain user demographics are underrepresented. This dataset should not be used for discriminatory purposes or to infer sensitive information about individuals or groups.

## Distribution

The dataset is publicly available on the Transport for London (TfL) website and Kaggle. While the exact license is not specified, it is likely under a Creative Commons license, which allows for sharing and adaptation with attribution.

## Maintenance

Transport for London (TfL) is the maintainer of the original dataset. The Kaggle version might not be actively updated.
